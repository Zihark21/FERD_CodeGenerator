# FERD_CodeGenerator

This is my first application I have made. That said the code may be a bit messy. The offsets I have build out myself but I wouldn't have been able to find all of these without all the existing codes out there. The code database are mostly codes I have found from random forums. I did make some of them but not all. If you have any issues with the program please report it on my discord. If you have a code you would like added to the Database tab that can also be submitted in the Requests chat. 

This program can generate code for both NTSC and PAL.
