# FERD_CodeGenerator

This is my first application I have made. That said the code is a bit messy. The offsets I have build out myself but I wouldn't have been able to find all of these without all the existing codes out there. Since most of these codes are generated, they don't technically have an author, but I will be researching some of the codes that I included in the database and be including them there. If there is a code in here that doesn't have an author and you know who made it, please send a message on my discord. If you have any issues with the program please report it on my discord. If you have a code you would like added to the Database tab that can also be submitted in the Requests chat.
